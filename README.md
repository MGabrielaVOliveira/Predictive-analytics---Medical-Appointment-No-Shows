This study was developed using the Medical Appointment No Shows dataset, available on Kaggle, which contains demographic, clinical, and logistical information related to medical appointments.

Patient no-shows have negative impacts on the healthcare system, such as wasted resources and increased waiting times.

- Patients with longer waiting times tend to miss appointments more often.
- Receiving SMS notifications is associated with appointment attendance behavior.
- Demographic and clinical variables have a moderate impact.

Even using a simple model, it was possible to identify relevant patterns related to no-shows at medical appointments. The project reinforces the importance of exploratory analysis and interpretation of results in Data Science.
